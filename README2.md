# Applied Machine Learning to Predict 1-Year Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in the Elderly After PCI

This repository contains the codebase for our study:  
**"Applied Machine Learning to Predict 1-Year Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in the Elderly After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)"**

We developed machine learning models‚Äîprimarily using XGBoost‚Äîto predict the risk of MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events) within one year after PCI in elderly patients. The model is trained on clinical, demographic, and laboratory data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mace-prediction.git
cd mace-prediction
```

### 2. Create Environment and Install Dependencies
```bash
conda create -n mace-pred python=3.9
conda activate mace-pred
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not present, install the main libraries manually:
```bash
pip install xgboost scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib shap seaborn scipy
```

## üöÄ Running the Code

### Option 1: Run Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook XGB.ipynb
```

Follow the notebook steps:
1. Load your dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.)
2. Preprocess data: normalization, encoding, SMOTE
3. Train XGBoost using stratified K-fold CV
4. Evaluate using AUC with CI, calibration, and SHAP
5. Visualize model results and interpret key features

### Option 2: Adapt Code for Scripted Training
Modularize the notebook for use in `.py` scripts (e.g., `train_xgb.py`, `plot_results.py`).

## üìä Output Examples

After running the notebook, you will get:

- `figures/roc_curve.png` ‚Äì ROC curve of the model
- `figures/calibration_curve.png` ‚Äì Calibration plot
- `figures/shap_summary.png` ‚Äì SHAP summary of top features

## üß™ Example Code Snippets

**Train Model with Cross-Validation**
```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

model = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=300, max_depth=4, learning_rate=0.05)
scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring='roc_auc')
print("Mean AUC:", scores.mean())
```

**SHAP Interpretability**
```python
import shap
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)
```

## üîí Data Privacy Notice

This repository does **not** contain any patient-level data. You must use your own anonymized dataset with the following structure:

- Demographics (e.g., Age, Gender)
- Clinical features (e.g., EF, DM, HTN)
- Labs (e.g., FBS, Creatinine)
- Target variable (e.g., `MACE_1y`: 0 or 1)
