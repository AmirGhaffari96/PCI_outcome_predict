# Applied Machine Learning to Predict 1-Year Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) After PCI in Elderly Patients

This repository contains the source code and workflows for our study applying machine learning (ML) techniques to predict 1-year MACE outcomes in elderly patients following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, SHAP interpretability, and model calibration.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Predict PCI outcome.py` | Main script for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation of multiple classifiers (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Network). |
| `Machine Learning Models Performance for PCI predict.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook for visualization and comparison of ML model performance using ROC curves, AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. |
| `ML model Calibration Plots for PCI predict.py` | Python script for calibration analysis using reliability curves and Brier scores, assessing probabilistic output quality of each model. |
| `XGBoost for PCI.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook for standalone implementation of XGBoost model with SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) visualization for interpretability. |

## ðŸ’» How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository

## ðŸš€ Execution Guide

### A. Full Pipeline
Run the following for complete data loading, model training, and evaluation:
```bash
python Predict\ PCI\ outcome.py
```

### B. Visualize Model Performance
Open:
```
Machine Learning Models Performance for PCI predict.ipynb
```
This notebook compares the ROC, AUC, and other metrics across models.

### C. Model Calibration
Run:
```bash
python ML\ model\ Calibration\ Plots\ for\ PCI\ predict.py
```
This script evaluates the calibration of predicted probabilities using plots and Brier scores.

### D. Interpretability with SHAP (XGBoost)
Open:
```
XGBoost for PCI.ipynb
```
This notebook provides SHAP visualizations to explain how input features affect the XGBoost model's predictions.
